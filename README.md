### Welcome to my ESP32 playground!

Components: <br>
:heavy_check_mark: 16x2 LCD display with HD44780 driver <br>
:heavy_check_mark: 160x128 LCD-TFT display with ST7735s driver <br>
:heavy_check_mark: build-in WiFi module <br>

This is so messy at the moment! Code is ready for displaying bitmaps on LCD screen and downloading global time over the internet. Will be put together in the future!
